# Near implementations of Popular Machine Learning Algorithms

ML Assignments done during Spring,2019 at IIT Delhi under Prof. Parag Singla

1. *Assignment 1*: {Linear,Logistic,Locally-Weighted Linear} ***Regression*** and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis***(GDA)*** was implemented.
2. *Assignment 2*: ***Naive Bayes*** and subgradient form of ***SVM*** were implemented.
3. *Assignment 3*: ***Decision Trees*** and ***Neural Networks*** were implemented.
4. *Assignment 4*: This was a competition part and a class competition was held. ***Deep Learning*** was used in this part, namely ***CNN*** architechture were used my best performing models. My best performing model and training guide is enclosed in report.
